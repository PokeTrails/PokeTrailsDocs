## Testing

### Front-end Testing

Front-end testing was conducted through multiple stages to ensure the application met our quality standards and functioned as intended across various environments.

#### Local Development Testing

Each feature was developed locally and thoroughly tested in a local development environment. This initial testing phase involved verifying the functionality of individual functions, components, and pages.

#### Public Development Testing

Once features were deemed stable in the local environment, they were pushed to a development branch. Here, testing was conducted using a public development database to simulate real-world usage and ensure compatibility with production settings. This phase also included testing on different devices and screen sizes, such as tablets and smartphones, to ensure the application‚Äôs accessibility and responsiveness.

#### Production User Testing

Features were then tested in a staging environment that closely mirrored the production setup. This phase involved gathering feedback from real users to validate the usability and functionality of the application in a near-production environment.

#### Automated Testing with Cypress

Automated tests were run using Cypress to validate the overall functionality and performance of the application. Cypress testing included various scenarios to ensure comprehensive coverage and identify any potential issues early in the development process.

Detailed results from user testing, including feedback and observations related to the login and sign-up workflows, are documented in a spreadsheet available in the GitHub repository. Additionally, a screenshot capturing further notes from the user testing is also provided in the same directory.

The results of the automated testing conducted with Cypress can be found in the Output.html file.

## R6 - Trello Board Project Management Screenshots (Part A)

We initially used Miro as our way brainstorming for the project and then moved onto Trello once the idea had been initialised and the features were sent in stone. This allowed for a Trello board that was a lot more stable from day 1 that didn't need many improvisations. Throughout the use of the Trello board we used many inbuilt features that allowed us to keep on track and progress at a steady pace, the features we used are:

- Due Dates
- Assigning Tasks
- Checklists
- Priorities

## Trello Project Management (Part B)

Much like our part A we used Trello as our main way of delgating tasks, tracking progress and setting due dates. We made extensive use of trello and its features to make the planning process simple and streamlined. On each Saturday we would update the trello board for new tasks to do during the coming week. 

Meeting had scheduled days on Saturday, Tuesday and Monday with meetings throughout the weeks if we had questions for each other or needed help. Our main way of organising these meetings were through discord, in the discord we then had a stored google meet link where we had conducted all our meetings. Using the discord server we had made was our main way of communicating and ideas or issue we had came accross in the development process.
